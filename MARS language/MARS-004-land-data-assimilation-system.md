# MARS Language Decision Record 004: Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS)

## Status
[~~Proposed~~ | **Accepted** | ~~Deprecated~~ | ~~Superseded by [ADR-XXX]~~]

## Context
The Land Data Assimilation (LDAS) system provides initial conditions of land surface parameters for the different forecasting systems which run on different time scales and model resolutions.

LDAS will run in research as well as operationally. Target forecasting systems which need LDAS initial conditions are the medium-range (MR), the sub-seasonal to seasonal (s2s) and the seasonal forecasting (SEAS) systems. In operational and some research configurations, LDAS data are produced as a near-real-time (NRT) product as well as a behind-real-time-product (BRT), which need to be distinguished. Data are needed in the FDB and will be archived in MARS.

Data from LDAS include analysis values and forecast values (e.g. surface fluxes). Analysis and forecast values for a given valid time will exist for the BRT and for the NRT at multiple lead times. The BRT will typically run each day covering the period up to 3 days previous. The NRT will run daily with a 5-day spinup and will be intialized from the BRT product. Additionally, diagnostic statistics such as monthly means will be produced at the end of each calendar month.

Operational configurations will run in parallel for each of MR, S2S and SEAS. The BRT component will include a reanalysis covering at least the previous 20 years. Different IFS cycles will typically (but not always) require a new reanalysis, so we need to distinguish re-analysis data produced with the same valid date for different IFS cycles as well as the different target forecast configurations. Upgrades of LDAS do not necessarily follow the release timeline of IFS cycles meaning that a newer IFS cycle still might use the LDAS system from the previous cycle/s. However, data volumes are very small and it would be possible to re-archive the data from a previous cycle with revised metadata to be consistent with a new cycle, this would be a matter for those configuring and running the operational suites and does not affect the design of the archive.


### Options Considered
1.	Data go under class od for the operational data and class rd for research data. This allows to have the same data layout in MARS for operational and for research data. Stream ldas will be created and is used for the instantaneous / high-frequency output and stream ldst for derived statistics. The distinction of behind-real-time (BRT) and near-real-time (NRT) is done using a new mars keyword mode, and data with different lead times in NRT mode will be distinguished using anoffset. The different target forecasting systems and the analysis producing cycle of the LDAS system are indexed in the mars key configuration which will be introduced for the hydrological data as well. The value of this key will be a concatenated string with first the model cycle of the LDAS analysis system and then the target model with MR for medium range, s2s for the extended range, and seas for the seasonal system. An example of the configuration is “50r1_s2s”. 

2.	Basically, the same approach as 1., but instead of labelling the target forecasting system with MR, s2s and seas, the MARS stream to which the target forecasting system belongs is used. So enfo for the medium-range, eefo for the sub-seasonal and mmsf for the seasonal system. Examples are configuration=50r1_enfo / 50r1_eefo / 50r1_mmsf. 

3.	This option is to create a new class ld for ldas, and to use the same stream as that of the target forecasting system (enfo/eefo/mmsf).

4. Option 4 is similar to option 1. In operations, class od is used while in research class rd. Instead of introducing a new key to distinguish BRT / NRT runs, just two separate streams are created. To archive statistics of the LDAS fields two additional statistical variants of these streams are created.

### Analysis
It was discussed to include a new class ld for ldas operational data, but we would need either a different solution for research data, which complicates life for everyone, or else a complicated solution for safely separating operational and research data in class=ld. Using new streams for the instantaneous and derived ldas / ldst statistics allows to have the same layout under class od and rd, and even member state classes should that be required in the future. It avoids relying on specific expver ranges reserved for research experiments, and allows a clean introduction of the required mars keywords under the new streams.

For hydrology data, a similar need for distinguishing different model configurations exists and it was agreed to introduce a new mars key configuration for this purpose.
The configuration key is ideally suited for the present use case as well and re-using it will enhance the consistency of mars.

It was considered that using the names of the streams (enfo/eefo/mmsf) in the configuration string might be more stable and less ambiguous than a “name” of the relevant forecast configuration (such as mr/s2s/seas), since the preferred names of our forecast systems have been changed several times in recent years (e.g. ENS>MR, EXT>SUBS>S2S) and may change again.


## Decision
Option 4 is the most approriate way for archiving LDAS. It has the advantage that operations and research can have the same layout. A new MARS key is not required. Four new mars streams will be created instead for the land data assimilation system. As there is at the moment only a distinction needed into a near-real-time and a behind-real-time configuration and as it is also unlikely that there will be more options, the stream names include this distinction rather adding an additional key in MARS with only two possible options. Two streams will be created for the statistics of the near-real-time and behind-real-time ldas data. The four streams will be the following ones:

| Stream mars abbreviation | Stream name |
|:------------:|:-------------|
| ldas | Land data-assimilation system (near real time)|
| ldbt | Land data-assimilation system behind real time |
| ldst | Land data-assimilation system statistics (near real time) |
| ldsb | Land data-assimilation system statistics behind real time |

The target forecasting system as well as the cycle of the LDAS system will be specified in the MARS key configuration using the cycle dash mars stream of the target system. It will contain entries like
* 49r2-sfdd
* 50r1-oper
* 50r1-enfo
* 50r1-sfdd
* 50r2-oper
* 50r2-enfo
* 50r2-sfdd

anoffset is included in the mars namespace of the near-real-time case and absent in the behind-real-time case. The mars key timespan is used and additionally in the statistical streams ldst and ldsb the mars key stattype. This allows to archive monthly and daily statistics and using the time keyword also monthly synoptic statistics are possible. 

### Related Decisions
This decisision is in line with the implementation done for the hydrological data.

## Consequences
The data will be completely new in MARS. SEAS6 will require LDAS data to provide land initial conditions, so a prompt implementation is needed to avoid delays.
